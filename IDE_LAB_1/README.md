##Completed Tasks
###### All tasks are done on a ubuntu operating system with git and vim installed

   - #####Create your own server (ex. virtual machine) (2 pt)
    
I've installed Virtual Machine with a UBUNTU guest operating system. <br>For installing the server I've used `sudo apt-get install ssh`, therefore I was able to manage the SSH-Server through `sudo service ssh (start | stop | restart)`

   - ####Connect to a remote server via SSH

I've connected to the remote server via Git Bash by using :`ssh username@address`

   - ####Initialize a repository on server

To initialize a repository on server go to your desired location, and use `git init` command. (if you're using git)

   - ####Create a file in repository folder, write in your name, save it and commit it
