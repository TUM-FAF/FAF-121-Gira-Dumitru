WINDOWS PROGRAMMING Laboratory Work 6
=====================================

Developing using C#. WinRT
--------------------------
<br>
##Completed Tasks
######Laboratory Work is done in Visual Studio 2012 IDE

  - **Create an Win32 or WinRT application using C#**

By creating a `Windows Forms Application` project the simplest C# application is created. It is a simple window with 3 basic elements: minimize, maximaze and close. The window can be resized.

  - **Convert a previous laboratory work to C#**

I've decided to rewrite my 1st laboratory work, from C++/Win32 in C#. It was a lot easier because I've used drag and drop feature. The controls that I've used are: Label (for text), MenuStrip (for creating the menu), Button (for pushbuttons), RichTextBox (for textboxes).

  - **Create a report (3pt)**

I've just got my 3 bonus points.

  - **Claim points for your own tasks (up to 7pt)**

      New features that were not present in 1st laboratory work:
    - Added a menu with `MenuStrip`, with options: `Exit` , `Change Background Color`, `About`
    - Added keyboard shortcuts; on `CTRL+W` - exiting from application, `CTRL+SPACE` - change bkg color, `F12` - displaying a dialog box
